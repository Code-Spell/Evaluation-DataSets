Furthermore, I would reduce the number of columns from 1 to 2 in the ""History"" page, concerning the assessments. One assessment per row would look less complex. About the assessments, I would also add a filter to search assessments by challenge, level, order by date, score and completion, for example.","By having a calendar with my submissions, I can analyse my consistency over the months.
