16/09/2024 21:18:42,Employee,,Advanced,No,3,2,3,4,2,"The feedback is too verbose and generic, I think it should be made much more succinct, or else it can be tiresome to read. Also, the recommended actions are very vague rather than concrete. Finally, it was not well understood how there were 49 breakdowns on the GRAPHICS section just by looking visually, maybe the feedback should not focus so much on the numbers but rather on their relative value (i.e. when compared with other metrics).",3,4,4,3,3,"The response is well structured. However, it seems it takes conclusions very surely from the given data, even when there can be multiple possible interpretations. It feels like the model is providing information for the sake of it. For instance, in my opinion, the proportion of time spent by the student on the CODING section compared to the MENU section seemed fair, as it is expected that CODING should take longer than MENU. Perhaps the model does not have full understanding of the subject matter to take informed conclusions. Rather, it tries to keep a balance in various aspects, even when that may not be the goal. Of course, data interpretation is very opinionated, but I think the model should take that into account instead of stating things as fact. It may make the students feel misunderstood.",3,1,1,2,2,"The response feels very generic and disconnected from the actual student data. I think this model also falls into the trap of providing information for the sake of it, simply to make the response feel ""complete"" (e.g. having always 3 bullet points per section). Some insights just do not seem to make sense, such as the strength of ""Breakdown details"" (it seems like it is evaluating the UI rather than the student) and ""Practice more"" (what is ""accuracy"" in this context?). The conclusion that the student must have spent time reviewing past attempts or making adjustments because they were not active for 3 seconds is ridiculous. The response structure is fine, but the model should be much more succinct and avoid making unfounded conclusions or suggestions.",4,4,5,5,4,"Converting absolute differences to percentages is very useful. Most conclusions taken seem to make sense, except for the ""Session breakdown"" recommendation which does not seem to derive from the data or previous statements, and even seems contradictory (the response previously said that the student had good time management and was active). The model may be attempting to introduce more information than it needs. The ""Implications and Enhancements"" section felt a little out of place to me.",1,1,2,1,2,"The first paragraph was good, but the rest of the response was either nonsensical or generic. The conclusions taken in the second and third paragraphs are wrong and do not derive from the data. All recommendations but the first one were disconnected from the evaluated student and could be applied to many other cases. The model should spend less text developing conclusions and providing feedback from those conclusions, as they seem to be wrong.",2,2,1,2,1,"This response is nonsensical, bloated, contradictory and generic. For one the model suggests removing time in the DOCUMENTATION and MENU sections even though in this context they do not make sense as suggestions, since it may be desirable to consult these sources. In terms of content, the response contains too much embellishment and introduces points just for the sake of it (it even duplicates the second point of the ""Strategy and Understanding"" section). It also contradicts itself, since it also suggests reinforcing the time spent in the GRAPHICS and CODING sections even though it was recommended to spend time in the DOCUMENTATION and MENU sections instead. Finally, it also spends text in presenting statements that can be applied to pretty much any student. The response should be made much more succinct, and in that process the answer may get less bloated and contradictory statements may be avoided. ",Option A,"I think something that is noticeable in these models (some more than the others) is that responses tend to be too large and include embellishment. Since these are snippets of feedback that the student/teacher may want to see frequently (for each challenge/student respectively), it is important that the responses are kept as succinct as possible. Maybe, since most responses are already structured like so, simply present the first paragraph which tends to be the summary, and include the other sections as collapsible boxes that the users can then open to see more info, rather than have a big answer all at once which can be hard to visually digest."
